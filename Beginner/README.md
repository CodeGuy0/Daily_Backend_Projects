# ðŸš€ Beginner Projects

Welcome to my **Daily Backend Beginner Projects**!  
The goal of this section is to practice and build **at least one beginner-level project every day** to strengthen core backend concepts.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ About
- This folder contains **daily small backend projects** made using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and other tools.  
- Each project will focus on **one specific concept** (CRUD operations, APIs, authentication, etc.).  
- These projects are **practice-oriented** and meant to create a strong foundation before moving to **Intermediate Projects**.
